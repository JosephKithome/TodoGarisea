# Garisea - ToDo List Web App

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm excited to share my solution to the Garisea code challenge. Garisea is a full-stack ToDo list web application built with NextJS, Redux, and GraphQL. 
This project was a fantastic opportunity to showcase my skills in frontend/API/backend development, engineering standards, modular component architecture, test-driven development, and UI design/development.

# Challenge Highlights

I successfully implemented the following features in the Garisea app:

- Added new todos to the list
- Marked todos as complete
- Deleted todos from the list
- Implemented filtering by all/active/complete todos
- Added functionality to clear all completed todos
- Ensured a responsive design for optimal user experience on various devices
- Bonus: Implemented drag and drop to reorder items on the list

 #Tools used
 - NextJs 13
 - Mongodb
 - Tailwind
 - Next-auth


### Technical Details

To meet the technical requirements:

- I used a MongoDB for data storage, calling data through a GraphQL API.
- Implemented user management and authentication, allowing only logged-in users to manage the todo list.
- Leveraged Redux and component states to manage CRUD tasks.
- Named the application "Garisea."
